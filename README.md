# SimpleWeb
It implements register, sign in, sign out, forgot password/reset password, and email send functionalities.

Getting started
Create an account by clicking on Register link in navigation bar above. 
You'll need an email service to activate your account!
I used my gmail account to send emails. Go over to Web.Config file in the project and scroll down to system.net section and hook up your email service.

Meanwhile...
I've created an account for you to use. Go over to login page and use:
Email: guest@user.com
Password: Gu3st@user.com

Protected content/resource
The only content/resource right now which needs authorization in this project is the "About" page.
